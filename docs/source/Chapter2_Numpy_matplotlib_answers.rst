While Python has a rich set of modules and data types by default, for
numerical computing you’ll be using two main libraries that conform the
backbone of the `Python scientific
stack <https://scipy.org/about.html>`__. These libraries implement a
great deal of functionality related to mathematical operations and
efficient computations on large data volumes. These libraries are
```numpy`` <http://numpy.org>`__ and ```scipy`` <http://scipy.org>`__.
``numpy``, which we will concentrate on in this section, deals with
efficient arrays, similar to lists, that simplify many common processing
operations. Of course, just doing calculations isn’t much fun if you
can’t plot some results. To do this, we use the
```matplotlib`` <http://matplotlib.org>`__ library.

But first, we’ll see the concept of *functions*\ ….

2.1 Functions
-------------

A function is a collection of Python statements that do something
(usually on some data). For example, you may want to convert from
Fahrenheit to Centigrade. The conversion is

.. math::


   ^{\circ}C = \left(^{\circ}F -32\right)\cdot\frac{5}{9}

A Python function will have a name (and we hope that the name is
self-explanatory as to what the function does), and a set of input
parameters. In the case above, the function would look like this:

.. code:: python

    def fahrenheit_to_centigrade(deg_fahrenheit):
        """A function to convert from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        deg_fahrenheit: float
            Temperature in degrees F
        
        Returns
        -------
        Temperature converted to degrees C
        """
        deg_c = (deg_fahrenheit - 32.)*5./9.
        return deg_c
        

We see that the function has a name (``fahrenheit_to_centigrade``), and
takes one parameter (``deg_fahrenheit``).

The main body of the function is indented (like ``if`` and ``for``
statements). There is first a comment string, that describes what the
function does, as well as what the inputs are, and what the output is.
This is just useful documentation of the code.

The main body of the function calculates ``deg_C`` from the given input,
and **returns** it back to the user.

Notice that the document string
``"""A function to convert from temperature... """`` is what is printed
when you request ``help`` on the function:

.. code:: python

    help(fahrenheit_to_centigrade)


.. parsed-literal::

    Help on function fahrenheit_to_centigrade in module __main__:
    
    fahrenheit_to_centigrade(deg_fahrenheit)
        A function to convert from degrees Fahrenheit to degrees Centigrade
        
        Parameters
        ----------
        deg_fahrenheit: float
            Temperature in degrees F
        
        Returns
        -------
        Temperature converted to degrees C
    


**E2.1.1 Exercise**

-  In the vein of converting units, write functions that convert from

   -  inches to m (and back)
   -  kg to stones (and back)

Hint: A stone is equal to 14 pounds, and a pound is equal to 0.45359237
kg.

**Ensure** that your functions are clearly named, have sensible variable
names, a brief docmentation string, and remember to test the functions
work: just demonstrate running the function with some input pairs where
you know the output and checking it makese sense.

.. code:: python

    # Space for your solution
    # ANSWER
    # conversion factors found from
    # googling
    
    def inches_to_metre(value_inches):
        '''
        convert input value in inches
        to metres
        '''
        return (value_inches * 0.0254)
    
    def metre_to_inches(value_metre):
        '''
        convert input value in metres
        to inches
        '''
        return (value_metre / 0.0254)
    
    def kg_to_stone(value_kg):
        '''
        convert input value in Kg to stone
        '''
        return(value_kg*0.157473)
    
    def stone_to_kg(value_stone):
        '''
        convert input value in stone to Kg
        '''
        return(value_stone/0.157473)
    
    # test:
    
    print('6 inches is',inches_to_metre(6),'m')
    print('70 Kg is',kg_to_stone(70),'stone')
    



.. parsed-literal::

    6 inches is 0.15239999999999998 m
    70 Kg is 11.02311 stone


2.2 ``numpy``
-------------

2.2.1 arrays
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You import the ``numpy`` library using

::

   import numpy as np

This means that all the functionality of ``numpy`` is accessed by the
prefix ``np.``: e.g. \ ``np.array``. The main element of ``numpy`` is
the numpy array. An array is like a list, but unlike a list, all the
elements are of the same type, floating point numbers for example.

Let’s see some arrays in action…

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np  # Import the numpy library
    
    # An array with 5 ones
    arr = np.ones(5)
    print(arr)
    print(type(arr))
    
    # An array started from a list of **integers**
    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])
    print(arr)
    
    # An array started from a list of numbers, what's the difference??
    arr = np.array([1., 2, 3, 4])
    print(arr)


.. parsed-literal::

    [1. 1. 1. 1. 1.]
    <class 'numpy.ndarray'>
    [1 2 3 4]
    [1. 2. 3. 4.]


In the example above we have generated an array where all the elements
are ``1.0``, using
```np.ones`` <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.ones.html>`__,
and then we have been able to generate arrays from lists using the
```np.array`` <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.array.html>`__
function. The difference between the 2nd and 3rd examples is that in the
2nd example, all the elements of the list are integers, and in the 3rd
example, one is a floating point number. ``numpy`` automatically makes
the array floating point by converting the integers to floating point
numbers.

What can we do with arrays? We can efficiently operate on individual
elements without loops:

.. code:: python

    arr = np.ones(10)
    print(2 * arr)


.. parsed-literal::

    [2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2. 2.]


``numpy`` is clever enough to figure out that the 2 multiplying the
array is applied to all elements of the array, and returns an array of
the same size as ``arr`` with the elements of ``arr`` multiplied by 2.
We can also multiply two arrays of the same size. So let’s create an
array with the numbers 0 to 9 and one with the numbers 9 to 0 and do a
times table:

.. code:: python

    arr1 = 9 * np.ones(10)
    arr2 = np.arange(1, 11)  # arange gives an array from 1 to 11, 11 not included
    
    print(arr1)
    print(arr2)
    
    print(arr1 * arr2)


.. parsed-literal::

    [9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9. 9.]
    [ 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
    [ 9. 18. 27. 36. 45. 54. 63. 72. 81. 90.]


**E2.2.1 Exercise**

-  Using code similar to the above and a ``for`` loop, write the times
   tables for 2 to 10. The solution you’re looking for should look a bit
   like this:

   ::

        [ 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20]
        [ 3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30]
        [ 4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40]
        [ 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50]
        [ 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60]
        [ 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70]
        [ 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80]
        [ 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90]
        [ 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100]

.. code:: python

    # Your solution here
    # ANSWER
    
    a = np.arange(1, 11)
    
    for b in range(2,11):
        print(a * b)
        


.. parsed-literal::

    [ 2  4  6  8 10 12 14 16 18 20]
    [ 3  6  9 12 15 18 21 24 27 30]
    [ 4  8 12 16 20 24 28 32 36 40]
    [ 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50]
    [ 6 12 18 24 30 36 42 48 54 60]
    [ 7 14 21 28 35 42 49 56 63 70]
    [ 8 16 24 32 40 48 56 64 72 80]
    [ 9 18 27 36 45 54 63 72 81 90]
    [ 10  20  30  40  50  60  70  80  90 100]


If the arrays are of the same *shape*, you can do standard operations
between them **element-wise**:

.. code:: python

    arr1 = np.array([3, 4, 5, 6.])
    arr2 = np.array([30, 40, 50, 60.])
    
    print(arr2 - arr1)
    print(arr1 * arr2)
    
    print("Array shapes:")
    print("arr1: ", arr1.shape)
    print("arr2: ", arr2.shape)


.. parsed-literal::

    [27. 36. 45. 54.]
    [ 90. 160. 250. 360.]
    Array shapes:
    arr1:  (4,)
    arr2:  (4,)


The ``numpy`` documenation is huge. There’s an `user’s
guide <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/index.html>`__, as well as
a reference to all the `contents of the
library <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/index.html>`__.
There’s even `a tutorial
availabe <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/user/quickstart.html>`__ if
you get bored with this one.

2.2.2 More detail about ``numpy.arrays``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

So far, we have seen a 1D array, which is the equivalent to a vector.
But arrays can have more dimensions: a 2D array would be equivalent to a
matrix (or an image, with rows and columns), and a 3D array would be a
volume split into voxels, as seen below

.. figure:: https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1120/1*Ikn1J6siiiCSk4ivYUhdgw.png
   :alt: numpy arrays

   numpy arrays

So a 1D array has one axis, a 2D array has 2 axes, a 3D array 3, and so
on. The ``shape`` of the array provides a tuple with the number of
elements along each axis. Let’s see this with some generally useful
array creation options:

.. code:: python

    # Create a 2D array from a list of rows. Note that the 3 rows have the same number of elements!
    arr1 = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3, 4], [5, 6, 7, 8, 9], [10, 11, 12, 13, 14]])
    # A 2D array from a list of tuples.
    # We're specifically asking for floating point numbers
    arr2 = np.array([(1.5, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6)], dtype=np.float)
    print("3*5 array:")
    print(arr1)
    print("2*3 array:")
    print(arr2)


.. parsed-literal::

    3*5 array:
    [[ 0  1  2  3  4]
     [ 5  6  7  8  9]
     [10 11 12 13 14]]
    2*3 array:
    [[1.5 2.  3. ]
     [4.  5.  6. ]]


2.2.3 Array creators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quite often, we will want to initialise an array to be all the same
number. The methods for doing this as 0,1 and unspecified in ``numpy``
are ``np.zeros()``, ``np.ones()``, ``np.empty()`` respectively.

.. code:: python

    # Creates a 3*4 array of 0s
    arr = np.zeros((3, 4))
    print("3*4 array of 0s")
    print(arr)
    
    # Creates a 2x3x4 array of int 1's
    print("2*3*4 array of 1s (integers)")
    arr = np.ones((2, 3, 4), dtype=np.int)
    print(arr)
    
    # Creates an empty (e.g. uninitialised) 2x3 array. Elements are random
    print("2*3 empty array (contents could be anything)")
    arr = np.empty((2, 3))
    print(arr)


.. parsed-literal::

    3*4 array of 0s
    [[0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0.]
     [0. 0. 0. 0.]]
    2*3*4 array of 1s (integers)
    [[[1 1 1 1]
      [1 1 1 1]
      [1 1 1 1]]
    
     [[1 1 1 1]
      [1 1 1 1]
      [1 1 1 1]]]
    2*3 empty array (contents could be anything)
    [[1.5 2.  3. ]
     [4.  5.  6. ]]


**Exercise E2.2.2**

-  write a function that does the following:

   -  create a 2-D tuple called ``indices`` containing the integers
      ``((0, 1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 6, 7, 8, 9))``
   -  create a 2-D numpy array called ``data`` of shape ``(5,10)``, data
      type ``int``, initialised with zero
   -  set the value of ``data[r,c]`` to be ``1`` for each of the 5
      row,column pairs specified in ``indices``.
   -  return the data array

-  print out the result returned

The result should look like:

::

   [[0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
    [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]]

**Hint**: You could use a ``for`` loop, but what does ``data[indices]``
give?

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    def doit():
        indices = ((0, 1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 6, 7, 8, 9))
        data = np.zeros((5,10),dtype=np.int)
        data[indices] = 1
        return(data)
    
    print(doit())


.. parsed-literal::

    [[0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1]]


**Exercise 2.2.3**

-  write a more flexible version of you function above where
   ``indices``, the value you want to set (``1`` above) and the desired
   shape of ``data`` are specified through function keyword arguments
   (e.g. ``indices=((0, 1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)),value=1,shape=(5,10)``)

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    def doit(indices = ((0, 1, 2, 3, 4),(5, 6, 7, 8, 9)),\
             shape   = (5,10),\
             value   = 1):
        
        data = np.zeros(shape,dtype=type(value))
        data[indices] = value
        return(data)
    
    print(doit(value=10.5))


.. parsed-literal::

    [[ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  10.5  0.   0.   0.   0. ]
     [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  10.5  0.   0.   0. ]
     [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  10.5  0.   0. ]
     [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  10.5  0. ]
     [ 0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.   0.  10.5]]


As well as initialising arrays with the same number as above, we often
also want to initialise with common data patterns. This includes simple
integer ranges ``(start, stop, skip)`` in a similar fashion to slicing
in the last session, or variations on this theme:

.. code:: python

    ### array creators
    
    print("1D array of numbers from 0 to 2 in increments of 0.3")
    start = 0
    stop  = 2.0
    skip  = 0.3
    
    arr = np.arange(start,stop,skip)
    print(f'arr of shape {arr.shape}:\n\t{arr}')
    
    start = 0
    stop  = 34
    nsamp = 9
    arr = np.linspace(start,stop,nsamp)
    print(f"array of shape {arr.shape} numbers equally spaced from {start} to {stop}:\n\t{arr}")
    
    np.linspace(stop,start,9)


.. parsed-literal::

    1D array of numbers from 0 to 2 in increments of 0.3
    arr of shape (7,):
    	[0.  0.3 0.6 0.9 1.2 1.5 1.8]
    array of shape (9,) numbers equally spaced from 0 to 34:
    	[ 0.    4.25  8.5  12.75 17.   21.25 25.5  29.75 34.  ]




.. parsed-literal::

    array([34.  , 29.75, 25.5 , 21.25, 17.  , 12.75,  8.5 ,  4.25,  0.  ])



**Exercise E2.2.4**

-  print an array of integer numbers from 100 to 1
-  print an array with 9 numbers equally spaced between 100 and 1

Hint: what value of skip would be appropriate here? what about ``start``
and ``stop``?

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    print(np.arange(100,0,-1))
    print(np.linspace(100,0,9))


.. parsed-literal::

    [100  99  98  97  96  95  94  93  92  91  90  89  88  87  86  85  84  83
      82  81  80  79  78  77  76  75  74  73  72  71  70  69  68  67  66  65
      64  63  62  61  60  59  58  57  56  55  54  53  52  51  50  49  48  47

    [100.   87.5  75.   62.5  50.   37.5  25.   12.5   0. ]


2.2.4 Summary statistics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Below are some typical arithmetic operations that you can use on arrays.
Remember that they happen **elementwise** (i.e. to the whole array).

.. code:: python

    b = np.arange(4)
    print(f'{b}^2 = {b**2}\n')
    
    a = np.array([20, 30, 40, 50])
    print(f"assuming in radians,\n10*sin({a}) = {10 * np.sin(a)}")
    
    print("\nSome useful numpy array methods for summary statistics...\n")
    print("Find the maximum of an array: a.max(): ", a.max())
    print("Find the minimum of an array: a.min(): ", a.min())
    print("Find the sum of an array: a.sum(): ", a.sum())
    print("Find the mean of an array: a.mean(): ", a.mean())
    print("Find the standard deviation of an array: a.std(): ", a.std())


.. parsed-literal::

    [0 1 2 3]^2 = [0 1 4 9]
    
    assuming in radians,
    10*sin([20 30 40 50]) = [ 9.12945251 -9.88031624  7.4511316  -2.62374854]
    
    Some useful numpy array methods for summary statistics...
    
    Find the maximum of an array: a.max():  50
    Find the minimum of an array: a.min():  20
    Find the sum of an array: a.sum():  140
    Find the mean of an array: a.mean():  35.0
    Find the standard deviation of an array: a.std():  11.180339887498949


Let’s access an interesting dataset on the frequency of satellite
launches to illustrate this.

.. figure:: https://media.giphy.com/media/26DNbCqVfLJbYrXIA/giphy.gif
   :alt: SpaceX landing

   SpaceX landing

.. code:: python

    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    
    '''
    This dataset gives the number of 
    satellites launched per month and year
    data from https://www.n2yo.com
    '''
    # We use the code supplied in nsat.py
    # to generate the dataset (takes time)
    # or to load it if it exists

    The std dev number of launches is 161.904 per month
    The median number of launches is 30.000 per month


Whilst we have generated some interesting summary statistics on the
dataset, it’s not really enough to give us a good idea of the data
characteristics.

To do that, we want to be able to ask somewhat more complex questions of
the data, such as, which *year* has the most/least launches? which month
do most launches happen in? which month in which year had the most
launches? which years had more than 100 launches?

To be able to address these, we need some new concepts:

-  methods ``argmin()`` and ``argmax()`` that provide the *index* where
   the min/max occurs
-  filtering and the related method ``where()``
-  ``axis`` methods: the dataset is two-dimensional, and for some
   questions we need to operate only over one of these

To illustrate:

.. code:: python

    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    import numpy as np
    
    data,years = nsat().data,nsat().years
    
    year = np.arange(years[0],years[1],dtype=np.int)
    
    # sum the data over all months (axis 0)
    sum_per_year = data.sum(axis=0)
    
    imax = np.argmax(sum_per_year)
    imin = np.argmin(sum_per_year)
    
    # filtering 
    # high(low) is an array set to True where the condition
    # is True, and False otherwise
    high = sum_per_year>=1000
    low  = sum_per_year<=300
    
    print(f'the year with most launches was {year[imax]} with {sum_per_year[imax]}')
    print(f'the year with fewest launches was {year[imin]} with {sum_per_year[imin]}')
    
    print('\nThe years with >= 1000 launches are:')
    print(year[high],'\nvalues:\n',sum_per_year[high])
    print('The years with <= 300 launches are:')
    print(year[low],'\nvalues:\n',sum_per_year[low])


.. parsed-literal::

    the year with most launches was 1999 with 4195
    the year with fewest launches was 1957 with 3
    
    The years with >= 1000 launches are:
    [1965 1975 1976 1981 1986 1987 1993 1994 1999 2006]

    values:

**Exercise E2.2.6**

-  copy the code above, and modify it to find the total launches *per
   month* (over all years)
-  show these data in a table

   most seldom take place in?

    month = np.arange(0,12)
    # OR BETTER AS STRINGS ... use datetime for things like this

    the month with most launches was May with 6504

    The months with >= 5000 launches are:

The form of filtering above (``high = sum_per_year>=1000``) produces a
numpy array of the same shape as that operated on (``sum_per_year``
here) of ``bool`` data type. It has entries of ``True`` where the
condition is met, and ``False`` where it is not met.

We can think of this logical array as a ‘data mask’ that we use to
select (filter) entries.

The figure shows ``log(sum_per_year)`` in the top line of the image
(numbers represented by colour shown in colourbar), then a
representation of the ``bool`` arrays ``high`` and ``low``. Where the
``bool`` value is shown yellow, the ‘data mask’ is true. |image0|

.. |image0| image:: images/arrayviz.png

.. code:: python

    print(f'{sum_per_year[high]}')
    print(f'{sum_per_year[low]}')


.. parsed-literal::

    [1527 1195 1264 1190 1375 1130 2131 1166 4195 1158]
    [  3  11  22  52 207 246 277 243 209 192]


Sometimes, instead of just applying the filter as above, we want to know
the indices of the filtered values.

To do this, we can use the ``np.where()`` method. This takes a ``bool``
array as its argument (such as our data masks or other conditions) and
returns a tuple of the indices where this is set ``True``.

.. code:: python

    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    data,years = nsat().data,nsat().years
    # where :
    # which months in the dataset were particularly busy ..
    # we select data > 400 as a condition 
    
    indices = np.where(data > 400)
    print(f'indices:\n{indices[0]}\n{indices[1]}')
    print(f'\ntype(indices): {type(indices)}')
    print(f'len(indices): {len(indices)}, len(indices[0]): {len(indices[0])}')
    print(f'type(indices[0][0]): {type(indices[0][0])}')
    
    year = np.arange(years[0],years[1],dtype=np.int)
    month = np.arange(12)
    
    nsamp = len(indices[0])
    
    # loop over the entries in the tuple
    print('*'*23)
    print('busy months')
    print('*'*23)
    for i in range(nsamp):
        print(f'{i:04d} month {month[indices[0][i]]:02d}'+\

You might notice the indices in the tuple derived above using ``where``
are *ordered*, but the effect of this is that the months are in
sequential order, rather than the years. We have

::

   month[indices[0][i]]
   year[indices[1][i]]

If we want to put the data in year order, there are several ways we
could go about this. An insteresting one, following the ideas in
``argmax()`` and ``argmin()`` above is to use ``argsort()``. This gives
the *indices* of the sorted array, rather than the values.

So here, we can find the *indices* of the year-sorted array, and apply
them to both ``month`` and ``year`` datasets:

.. code:: python

    # prepare data as above
    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    data,years = nsat().data,nsat().years
    indices = np.where(data > 400)
    year = np.arange(years[0],years[1],dtype=np.int)
    month = np.arange(12,dtype=np.int)
    
    # store the months and years
    # in their unsorted (original) form
    unsorted_months = month[indices[0]]
    unsorted_years = year[indices[1]]
    print(f'years not in order: {unsorted_years}')
    print(f'but months are:     {unsorted_months}\n')
    
    
    # get the indices to put years in order
    year_order = np.argsort(indices[1])
    
    # apply this to months and years
    print(f'year order: {year_order}\n')
    print(f'years in order: {unsorted_years[year_order]}')
    print(f'months in year order: {unsorted_months[year_order]}')



.. parsed-literal::

    years not in order: [1986 1970 1994 1999 1981 1993 2006 1976 1997 2000 1965 1999]
    but months are:     [1 3 4 4 5 5 5 6 8 8 9 9]
    
    year order: [10  1  7  4  0  5  2  8  3 11  9  6]

2.2.5 Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, you have been introduced to more detail on arrays in
``numpy``. The big advantages of ``numpy`` are that you can easily
perform array operators (such as adding two arrays together), and that
``numpy`` has a large number of useful functions for manipulating
N-dimensional data in array form. This makes it particularly appropriate
for raster geospatial data processing.

We have seen how to create various forms of array (e.g. ``np.ones()``,
``np.arange()``), how to calculate some basic statistics (``min()``,
``max()`` etc), and finding the array index where some pattern occurs
(e.g. ``argmin()``, ``argsort()`` or ``where()``).

2.3 Plotting with Matplotlib
----------------------------

There are `quite a few graphical libraries for
Python <https://scipy.org/topical-software.html#plotting-data-visualization-3-d-programming>`__,
but `matplotlib <http://matplotlib.org>`__ is probably the most famous
one. It does pretty much all you need in terms of 2D plots, and simple
3D plots, and is fairly straightforward to use. Have a look at the
`matplotlib gallery <https://matplotlib.org/gallery/index.html>`__ for a
fairly comprehensive list of examples of what the library can do as well
as the code that was used in the examples.

**Importing matplotlib**

You can import matplotlib with

   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

As with ``numpy``, it’s custom to use the ``plt`` prefix to call
matplotlib commands. In the notebook, you should also issue the
following command just after the import

::

   %matplotlib notebook

or

::

   %matplotlib inline

The former command will make the plots in the notebook interactive
(i.e. point-and-click-ey), and the second will just stick the plots into
the notebook as PNG files.

**Simple 2D plots**

The most basic plots are 2D plots (e.g. x and y).

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    
    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    import numpy as np
    '''
    This dataset gives the number of 
    satellites launched per month and year
    
    data from https://www.n2yo.com
    '''
    data,years = nsat().data,nsat().years
    year = np.arange(years[0],years[1],dtype=np.int)
    # sum the data over all months (axis 0)
    sum_per_year = data.sum(axis=0)
    
    print(f'data shape {data.shape}')
    
    # plot x as year
    # plot y as the number of satellites per year
    plt.plot(year,sum_per_year,label='launches per year')

Whilst this plot is fine, there are a few simple things we could do
improve it.

We will go through some of the options below, but to get a taste of
improved ploitting, lets use e.g.:

-  reset the image shape/size

   -  ``plt.figure(figsize=(13,3))``

-  plot the mean value (as a red dashed line) for comparison

   -  ``plt.plot([year[0],year[-1]],[mean,mean],'r--',label='mean')``

-  limit the dataset to range of variable ``year``

   -  ``plt.xlim(year[0],year[-1])``

-  put labels on the x and y axes

   -  ``plt.xlabel('year')``
   -  ``plt.ylabel('# satellite launches')``

-  set a title

   -  ``plt.title('data from https://www.n2yo.com')``

-  use a legend (in conjunction with ``label=`` using ``plot``)

   -  ``plt.legend(loc='best')``

-  use a log scale in the y-axis

   -  ``plt.semilogy()``

What you choose to do will depend on what you want to show on the graph,
but the examples above are quite common.

.. code:: python

    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    %matplotlib inline
    from geog0111.nsat import nsat
    import numpy as np
    '''data as above'''
    data,years = nsat().data,nsat().years
    year = np.arange(years[0],years[1],dtype=np.int)
    sum_per_year = data.sum(axis=0)
    
    # calculate mean of sum_per_year
    mean = sum_per_year.mean()
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(13,3))
    plt.plot(year,sum_per_year,label='launches per year')
    plt.plot([year[0],year[-1]],[mean,mean],'r--',label='mean')
    plt.xlim(year[0],year[-1])
    plt.xlabel('year')
    plt.ylabel('# satellite launches')
    plt.title('data from https://www.n2yo.com')
    plt.legend(loc='best')
    plt.semilogy()

**Exercise E2.3.1**

-  produce a plot showing launches per year as a function of year,
   showing data for selected months individually.

Hint: do a simple plot first, then add some improvements gradually. You
might set up a list of months to process and use a loop to go over each
month.

.. code:: python

**Exercise 2.3.2**

Putting together some ideas from above to look at some turning points in
a function:

-  generate a numpy array called ``x`` with 100 equally spaced numbers
   between 0 and 5
-  generate a numpy array called ``y`` which contains
   :math:`x^3 - 9 x^2 + 26 x - 24`
-  plot ``y`` as a function of ``x`` with a red line
-  plot **only positive** values of ``y`` (as a function of ``x``) with
   a green line

Hint: to plot with red and green line ``plot(x,y,'r')`` and
``plot(x,y,'g')``

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    x = np.linspace(0,5,100)
    y = x**3 - 9 * x**2 + 26 * x - 24
    # mask for +ve y
    w = y > 0
    
    '''
    Its quite difficult to get the green line right
    as it has a gap in the middle
    so may be better to plot with symbols eg +
    '''
    plt.plot(x,y,'r-')
    plt.plot(x[w],y[w],'g+')

2.4 Indexing and slicing arrays
-------------------------------

2.4.1 Recap
~~~~~~~~~~~

Selecting different elements of the array to operate in them is a very
common task. ``numpy`` has a very rich syntax for selecting different
bits of the array. We have come across slicing before, but it is so
important to array processing, we will go over some of it again.

Similar to lists, you can refer to elements in the array by their
position. You can also use the ``:`` symbol to specify a range (a
**slice**) of positions ``first_element:(last_element+1``. If you want
to start counting from the end of the array, use negative numbers:
``-1`` refers to the last element of the array, ``-2`` the one before
last and so on. In a slice, you can also specify a step as the third
element in ``first_element:(last_element+1:step``. If the step is
negative you count from the back.

All this probably appears mind bogging, but it’s easier shown in
practice. You’ll get used to it quite quickly once you start using it

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    
    a = np.array([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])
    print(a[2])      # 2
    print(a[2:5])    # [2, 3, 4]
    print(a[-1])     # 10
    print(a[:8])     # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
    print(a[2:])     # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
    print(a[5:2:-1]) # [5, 4, 3]



.. parsed-literal::

    2
    [2 3 4]
    10
    [0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7]
    [ 2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10]
    [5 4 3]


The concept extends cleanly to multidimensional arrays…

.. code:: python

    b = np.array([[0, 1, 2, 3], [10, 11, 12, 13], [20, 21, 22, 23], [30, 31, 32, 33],
         [40, 41, 42, 43]])
    
    print(b[2, 3])    # 23
    print(b[0:5, 1])  # each row in the second column of b 
    print(b[:, 1])    # same thing as above 
    print(b[1:3, :])  # each column in the second and third row of b


.. parsed-literal::

    23
    [ 1 11 21 31 41]
    [ 1 11 21 31 41]
    [[10 11 12 13]
     [20 21 22 23]]


**Exercise 2.4.1**

-  generate a 2-D numpy array of integer zeros called ``x``, of shape
   (7,7)
-  we can think of this as a square. Set the central 3 by 3 samples of
   the square to one
-  print the result

Hint: Don’t use looping, instead work out how to define the slice of the
central 3 x 3 samples.

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    x = np.zeros((7,7)).astype(int)
    r0,c0 = x.shape
    cx,cy = int(r0/2),int(c0/2)
    
    x[cx-1:cx+2,cy-1:cy+2] =1
    
    print(x)


.. parsed-literal::

    [[0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]
     [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]
     [0 0 1 1 1 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]
     [0 0 0 0 0 0 0]]


2.4.1 data mask
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A useful way to select elements is by using what’s called a mask as we
saw above: an array of logical (boolean) elements that only selects the
elements that are ``True``:

.. code:: python

    a = np.arange(10)
    select_me = a >= 7
    print(a[select_me])


.. parsed-literal::

    [7 8 9]


The previous point also shows something interesting: you can apply
comparisons element by element. So in the previous example,
``select_me`` is a 10 element array where all the elements of ``a`` that
are equal or higher than 7 are set to True.

If you want to build up element by element logical operations, it’s best
to use specialised functions like
```np.logical_and`` <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.logical_and.html>`__
and friends

.. code:: python

    a = np.arange(100)
    sel1 = a > 45
    sel2 = a < 73
    print(a[np.logical_and(sel1, sel2)])


.. parsed-literal::

    [46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 61 62 63 64 65 66 67 68 69
     70 71 72]


**Exercise 2.4.2**

-  generate a numpy array called ``x`` with 100 equally spaced numbers
   between 0 and 5
-  generate a numpy array called ``y`` which contains
   :math:`x^3 - 9 x^2 + 26 x - 24`
-  print the values of ``x`` for which ``y`` is greater than or equal to
   zero and ``x`` lies between 3.5 and 4.5

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    x = np.linspace(0,5,100)
    y = x**3 - 9*x**2 + 26*x - 24
    
    # conditions
    w1 = np.logical_and(x>3.5,x<=4.5)
    w2 = np.logical_and(y >= 0,w1)
    print(x[w2])

2.5 Reading data
----------------

2.5.1 ``np.loadtxt``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It’s a bit tedious just making up numbers to play with them, but it’s
easy to load up data from external files. The most common data
interchange format is `CSV (comma-seperated
values) <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>`__, a
plain text format. Think of CSV as a plain text table. Each element in
each row is separated by a comma (although other symbols, such as white
space, semicolons ``;``, tabs ``\t`` or pipe ``|`` symbols are often
found as delimiters). The first few lines might contain some metadata
that describes the dataset, and the first line will also contain the
names of the headers of the different columns. Lines starting with ``#``
tend to be ignored. An example file might look like this

::

   # Monthly transatlantic airtravel, in thousands of passengers, for 1958-1960. 
   # There are 4 fields, "Month", "1958", "1959" and "1960" and 12 records, "JAN" through "DEC". 
   # There is also an initial header line.
   # And some lines with comments starting with #
   # Data obtained from https://people.sc.fsu.edu/~jburkardt/data/csv/csv.html
   "Month", "1958", "1959", "1960"
   "JAN",  340,  360,  417
   "FEB",  318,  342,  391
   "MAR",  362,  406,  419
   "APR",  348,  396,  461
   "MAY",  363,  420,  472
   "JUN",  435,  472,  535
   "JUL",  491,  548,  622
   "AUG",  505,  559,  606
   "SEP",  404,  463,  508
   "OCT",  359,  407,  461
   "NOV",  310,  362,  390
   "DEC",  337,  405,  432

We can see the first few lines are comments or metadata, the first line
without a ``#`` is the headers, and we note that text is entered between
``"``\ s. In this case, the delimiter is a comma. We can read the data
as an array with
```np.loadtxt`` <https://docs.scipy.org/doc/numpy/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html>`__,
telling it…

-  to ignore lines starting by #
-  to ignore the first column as it’s text
-  to note that the separator is a comma

.. code:: python

    air_travel = np.loadtxt("data/airtravel.csv", comments="#", skiprows=6, \
                            usecols=[1,2,3], delimiter=",")
    print(air_travel)
    print(air_travel.shape)


.. parsed-literal::

    [[340. 360. 417.]
     [318. 342. 391.]
     [362. 406. 419.]
     [348. 396. 461.]
     [363. 420. 472.]
     [435. 472. 535.]
     [491. 548. 622.]
     [505. 559. 606.]
     [404. 463. 508.]
     [359. 407. 461.]
     [310. 362. 390.]
     [337. 405. 432.]]
    (12, 3)


While ``np.loadtxt`` is quite flexible for dealing with text files,
```pandas`` <https://pandas.pydata.org>`__ absolutely shines at working
with tabular data. You can find a `pandas quickstart tutorial
here <https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html>`__ if you
are curious about it!

Before we go into plotting, we can do some fun calculations (yay!) using
our airtravel data

**Exercise 2.5.1**

-  Calculate the total number of passengers per year
-  Calculate the average number of passengers per month
-  Can you spot any trends in the data?

Hint: Remember the ``.sum()``, ``.mean()`` methods for arrays?

.. code:: python

    # Space for your solution
    # ANSWER
    
    # shape is (12,3) so, month, year
    
    '''
    for examining data, do a plot:
    
    we see a clear summer month peak!!
    
    '''
    print(f'total passengers per year: {air_travel.sum(axis=0)}')
    print(f'mean passengers per month: {air_travel.mean(axis=1)}')
    
    plt.plot(air_travel.mean(axis=1))


.. parsed-literal::

    total passengers per year: [4572. 5140. 5714.]
    mean passengers per month: [372.33333333 350.33333333 395.66666667 401.66666667 418.33333333

Let’s plot our previous air travel dataset… We’ll plot it as annual
lines, so the x axis will be month number (running from 1 to 12) and the
y axis will be 1000s of passengers. Different line colours will be used
for every year. We’ll also add x and y axes labels, as well as a legend:

.. code:: python

    # You can probably just put this at the top of every notebook you write
    # Adding it here for completeness
    %matplotlib inline
    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    
    
    # Load airtravel data
    air_travel = np.loadtxt("data/airtravel.csv", skiprows=6, \
                            unpack=True, usecols=[1,2,3], delimiter=",")
    
    mths = np.arange(1, 13)
    plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[0], '-', label="1958")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[1], '-', label="1959")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[2], '-', label="1960")
    plt.xlabel("Month")
    plt.ylabel("1000s of travellers per month")
    plt.legend(loc="best")




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x11d5e4898>




.. image:: Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_files/Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_80_1.png


You may not want to use lines to join the data points, but symbols like
dots, crosses, etc.

.. code:: python

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[0], 'x', label="1958")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[1], '+', label="1959")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[2], 'o', label="1960")
    plt.xlabel("Month")
    plt.ylabel("1000s of travellers per moth")
    plt.legend(loc="best")




.. parsed-literal::

    <matplotlib.legend.Legend at 0x122220d30>




.. image:: Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_files/Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_82_1.png


We can also use dots **and** lines. Moreover, we can change the type of
line: from full lines to dashed to dash-dot…

.. code:: python

    plt.figure(figsize=(10,3))
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[0], 'x-', label="1958")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[1], '+--', label="1959")
    plt.plot(mths, air_travel[2], 'o-.', label="1960")
    plt.xlabel("Month")
    plt.ylabel("1000s of travellers per moth")
    plt.legend(loc="best")

**Exercise 2.5.2**

The file ```NOAA.csv`` <data/NOAA.csv>`__ contains data from
`NOAA <http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/E11.html>`__ on the number of
storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic basin from 1851 to 2015. The data
columns are described in the first row of the file. The year is in
column 1 and the number of hurricanes in column 3.

For those interested, the data is pulled from the website with
`getNOAA.py <geog0111/getNOAA.py>`__.

-  load the year and hurricane data from the file
   ```NOAA.csv`` <data/NOAA.csv>`__ into a numpy array
-  produce a plot showing the number of hurricanes as a function of
   year, with the data plotted in a blue line
-  put a dashed red line on the graph showing the mean number of
   hurricanes
-  plot circle symbols for all years where the number of hurricanes is
   greater than the mean + 1.96 standard deviations.

Hint: the options on ``np.loadtxt`` you probably want to use are:
``skiprows``, ``delimiter``, ``usecol`` and ``unpack``. You will need to
select the data that meet the required conditions, combining the
conditions with ``np.logical_and()``.

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    
    datafile = 'data/NOAA.csv'
    data = np.loadtxt(datafile,skiprows=1,delimiter=',',\
                      usecols = (1,3),unpack=True)
    
    mean = data[1].mean()
    std  = data[1].std()
    
    w = data[1] > mean + 1.96 * std
    
    plt.plot(data[0],data[1],label='number of hurricanes')
    plt.plot([data[0][0],data[0][-1]],[mean,mean],'r--',label='mean')
    plt.plot(data[0][w],data[1][w],'o',label='+ve outliers')
    plt.legend(loc='best')

2.5.2 ``requests``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We can use ``np.loadtxt`` or similar functions to load tabular data that
we have stored locally in e.g. csv format.

Sometimes we will need pull a data file from a
`URL <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL>`__. We have used this idea
previously to ‘scrape’ data from a web page, but often the task is more
straightforward, and we effectively need only to ‘download’ the data in
the file.

We will use the ``requests`` package to do this and pull the data as a
string. We then use ``StringIO`` to allow ``np.loadtxt`` to think the
string comes from a data file.

.. code:: python

    import requests
    from io import StringIO
    
    # Define the URL with the parameters of interest
    url = "https://daymet.ornl.gov/single-pixel/api/" + \
            "data?lat=45.4&lon=-115.0534&vars=tmax&start=2000-01-01&end=2009-12-31"
    
    data = requests.get(url).text
    
    # You can check the text file to see its contents, but we now
    # (i) it's separated by commas
    # (ii) the first 8 lines are metadata that we're not interested in.
    temperature = np.loadtxt(StringIO(data), skiprows=8, delimiter=",", unpack=True)
    
    # We expect to get 10 years of data here, so 3650 daily records
    # the data are given for 365 days per year ...
    print(temperature.shape)

If we want to store the data file, we can do so by opening a file:

.. code:: python

    # We open the output file, `daymet.csv`
    with open("data/daymet_tmax.csv", 'w') as fp:
        # make the HTTPS connection and pull text
        # then write to file
        r = fp.write(data)
    
    # You can check the text file to see its contents, but we now
    # (i) it's separated by commas
    # (ii) the first 9 lines are metadata that we're not interested in.
    temperature = np.loadtxt("data/daymet_tmax.csv", skiprows=8, delimiter=",", unpack=True)
    
    # We expect to get ~10 years of data here, so 3650 daily records
    print(temperature.shape)


.. parsed-literal::

    (3, 3650)


The data columns are: ``Year``, ``day of year`` (1 to 365) and ``Tmax``
(:math:`C`).

How can we plot such data? the technical issue we face is needing to use
the first *two* columns of data (day of year and year) to describe the
x-axis location.

.. code:: python

    print('Year ',temperature[0])
    print('DOY  ',temperature[1])
    print('T_max',temperature[2])


.. parsed-literal::

    Year  [2000. 2000. 2000. ... 2009. 2009. 2009.]
    DOY   [  1.   2.   3. ... 363. 364. 365.]
    T_max [-1.5 -2.5 -1.5 ... -1.5 -3.  -2. ]


A simple way of doing this, that would suffice here, would be to convert
day of year to year fraction, then we could write:

::

   year,doy,tmax = temperature
   dates = year + (doy-1)/365.

A more elegant way might be to use
```datetime`` <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html>`__. This
contains a set of methods that allow you to manipulate date formats.
``matplotlib`` understands the format used, and so it is generally
appropriate to use ``datetime`` for date information when plotting.

::

   year,doy,tmax = temperature
   dates = [datetime.datetime(int(y), 1, 1) + \
        datetime.timedelta(d - 1) for y,d in zip(year,doy)]

.. code:: python

    import datetime
    
    year,doy,tmax = temperature
    dates = year + (doy-1)/365.
    # using the simple way here
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(14,3))
    plt.plot(dates,tmax)
    plt.title(url)
    plt.ylabel('$T_{max} / C$')
    plt.xlabel('year')




.. parsed-literal::

    Text(0.5, 0, 'year')

**Exercise E2.5.3**

-  use the datetime approach to plot the dataset
-  print out the value of ``dates`` for the first 10 entries to see what
   the format looks like

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    import datetime
    
    year,doy,tmax = temperature
    
    # see above!
    dates = [datetime.datetime(int(y), 1, 1) + \
         datetime.timedelta(d - 1) for y,d in zip(year,doy)]
    
    # using the simple way here
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(14,3))
    plt.plot(dates,tmax)
    plt.title(url)
    plt.ylabel('$T_{max} / C$')
    plt.xlabel('year')




.. parsed-literal::

    Text(0.5, 0, 'year')

Although we have used this as a one-dimensional dataset (temperature as
a function of time) we could also think of it as two-dimensional
(temperature as a function of (year,doy)). Recall that the ``shape`` of
the ``temperature`` dataset was ``(3,3650)``. We could put the
temperature column into a gridded dataset of shape ``(10,365)`` which
would then emphasise the 2-D nature.

We can do this with the ``numpy`` method ``reshape()``.

.. code:: python

    year = temperature[0].reshape(10,365)
    doy  = temperature[1].reshape(10,365)
    tmax = temperature[2].reshape(10,365)
    
    plt.figure(figsize=(14,3))
    plt.plot(doy,tmax,'x')
    plt.title(url)
    plt.ylabel('$T_{max} / C$')
    plt.xlabel('day of year')
    plt.xlim([1,366])




.. parsed-literal::

    (1, 366)




.. image:: Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_files/Chapter2_Numpy_matplotlib_answers_99_1.png


Plotting this, we can visualise the year-on-year variations in
temperature for any particular day.

**Exercise E2.5.3**

-  using the reshaped datasets above, calculate and plot the mean value
   of ``tmax`` as a function of day of year
-  calculate standard deviation of ``tmax`` as a function of day of
   year, and plot dashed lines at mean +/- 1.96 standard deviations
-  in another plot, show the mean, +/- 1.96 standard deviations of
   ``tmax`` as a function of year (i.e. the annual average and standard
   deviation)

Hint: use ``axis=0`` when calculating the mean/std over ``doy`` of
``tmax`` and ``axis=1`` for processing over ``year``.

.. code:: python

    # do exercise here
    # ANSWER
    
    meanval = tmax.mean(axis=1)
    stdval = tmax.std(axis=1)
    
    plt.plot(year[:,0],meanval)
    plt.plot(year[:,0],meanval+1.96*stdval,'k--')
    plt.plot(year[:,0],meanval-1.96*stdval,'k--')

2.5.4 Homework
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Exercise E2.5.4
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Select 4 locations in different regions of North America
(e.g. Anchorage, Albuquerque, Seattle, Chicago). Request data on maximum
temperature, precipitation and incident solar radiation for the years
between 1981 to 2010, and plot in 3 different figures:

-  Figure 1: The *mean daily temperature* and the variation (a shaded
   area around the mean going from mean value **minus** 1.96 times the
   standard deviation to mean value **plus** 1.96 times the standard
   deviation). Use a subplot or panel for each site
-  Figure 2: The *mean daily precipitation* and the variation (a shaded
   area around the mean going from mean value **minus** 1.96 times the
   standard deviation to mean value **plus** 1.96 times the standard
   deviation). Use a subplot or panel for each site
-  Figure 3: The *mean daily incident solar radiation* and the variation
   (a shaded area around the mean going from mean value **minus** 1.96
   times the standard deviation to mean value **plus** 1.96 times the
   standard deviation). Use a subplot or panel for each site

In each plot, the mean value should be a full line, and the variation
should be an envelope, visually similar to the plot shown below (clearly
not identical!!!!)

   :alt: la niña plot

   la niña plot

Label each plot with a title, units and so on. Some useful functions to
consider

-  ```plt.subplots`` <https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.subplots.html>`__
   Allows you to split a figure into several panels or subplots. In
   particular, pay attention to the ``sharex`` and ``sharey`` options
   that allow you to have the same scales for all plots so they can be
   directly compared.
-  ```plt.fill_between`` <https://matplotlib.org/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.fill_between.html>`__
   Allows you to fill the space between two curves. You may want to give
   the option ``color=0.8`` for a nice grey effect.

2.5.5 Summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this section, we have learned about reading data from csv files from
the local disc or that we have pulled from the web (given a URL). We
have gone into a little more detail and sophistication on plotting
graphs, and you now should be able to produce sensible plots of datasets
or summaries of datasets (e.g. mean standard deviation).
