Bug fixes since 1.3.3
=====================

sorted DEM problems

Bug fixes since 1.3.4
=====================

made to work with curl is wget not available (looks in /usr/bin/curl first)

Version 1.4.0
=====================
Major version ... Image format now envi (and a slightly limited interpretation of that).
Can't guarantee will work with hips images but need to track down the cases that cause problems.

Old codes available from 
http://www2.geog.ucl.ac.uk/~plewis/bpms/src/lib/version_1.3.5/ still.
that could be re-instated if there are big problems.

Version 1.4.1
=============

Fixed to work with *either* hipl or envi format as input and output. Assumes envi format unless a .hips (or .HiPs etc) tail seen.

Version 1.4.1a
=============

Edited configure script to only output README if -readme or -version specified (then exit).


Version 1.4.1b
=============

Added new primitive object: spheroid 

use in a .obj file e.g.:

v 0 0 0
v 0 1 1
spheroid -1 -2 0.2

where:
spheroid <base> <tip> radius

This is of course similar to the ell (ellipsoid) object but may be more convenient under some circumstances as it does not *require* cloning and rotating to achieve a spheroid (e.g. a needle on a tree) with arbitrary base and tip location.

The motivation for this is the 3DVegLab project.
